Linux Router Configuration Utility


My goal with this package is to provide an interface similar to JunOS/Cisco for the various linux systems and services.
(Networking, Firewall, QoS, Asterisk, Postfix)

This project is still very lightweight, and not at all functional. (YET) 
Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to get involved, or have suggestions towards the project.
